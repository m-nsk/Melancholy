Today’s been uneventful, today i was like : “hey! why not and try to reduce time on social media?” easier than done. I’ve had a couple breaks here and there to tell my friends that i will not be online since i wanna focus on school [which is partly true, the second of myself just wants to get some shit done and break this chain] been doing ok so far, done some of my missing assignments. Rushed the mathematics one since i don’t understand shit there, but hopefully that's ok. [might ask for help there since i suck at maths] Been feeling anxious aswell, as one of the reasons I even open social media is to check if i'm being cancelled or not since that was one of my biggest fears.

I’ll miss my friends probably. They’re the ones who are keeping me from doing self h*rm, but since i’m trying to focus on other shit and get a break from social media i’ll have to do it by my own accord… i guess… This will be tough.. hh…. Anyways, on other news, I can properly try and do research about mental conditions and educate myself better on topics like those. Probably won't get the time to do it haha. That's all i can think about writing rn. Hope this jogs my memory up a bit. Thanks for reading this vent ish chapter <3
